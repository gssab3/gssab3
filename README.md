## Hi there ğŸ‘‹
I am Giuseppe Sabetta, a student in the Computer Science course at the University of Salerno.

ğŸŒ± Over time, I began to appreciate the design of each application more and more and my university projects represent my growth. The statistics regarding my commits in the repositories I have worked on show what my forte really is, namely business logic, distributed system design and database modelling. 

ğŸ”­ My aim is not just to design, but to make every project I am part of a secure project
