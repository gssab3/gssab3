## Hi there üëã
I am Giuseppe Sabetta, a student in the Computer Science course at the University of Salerno.

üå± Over time, I began to appreciate the design of each application more and more and my university projects represent my growth. The statistics regarding my commits in the repositories I have worked on show what my forte really is, namely business logic, distributed system design and database modelling. 

üî≠ My aim is not just to design, but to make every project I am part of a **secure** project

üíª Currently, I am working on two independent projects. The first is an educational technology website focused on computer science news and current events. The second is an innovative project aimed at improving interpersonal relationships in school settings. These projects reflect my commitment to using technology not only for secure and efficient design but also for fostering better communication and learning experiences.
